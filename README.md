# PyTorch MNIST Classifier

A simple neural network implemented in PyTorch to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the process of building and training a neural network using PyTorch to classify images of handwritten digits. The MNIST dataset is used, which consists of 28x28 grayscale images of digits from 0 to 9. The goal is to train a model that can accurately predict the digit present in each image.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- matplotlib

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/chriswilder3/MNSIT-pytorch.git

2. Run the python or notebook file.

This will train the neural network on the MNIST dataset and save the trained model's state dictionary to `state_dict.pt`.
